Only the folders `publish` and `datebase` are needed; the rest is source code.

Put the files from `datebase` into the user's home directory, and the folder `mssqllocaldb` in to `userhome\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances`

Execute `store.exe` in `publish` and go to the url in the console it opens.
