# A web store front for used video games

Only the folders `publish` and `datebase` are needed; the rest is source code.

In the folder `database` take the folder `storeSQL` and put it into the C drive then, take `mssqllocaldb` and put it into `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Local DB\Instances`.

A window auth login must be made for the SQL server called `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb`. A passwordless login called `free` can be used to create the window authentication.

Execute `store.exe` in `publish` and go to the url in the console it opens.
